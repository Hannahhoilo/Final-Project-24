In the final project i'm using firebase authentication, where you have to log in to the page.
If you donâ€™t already have a user to log in with, you can make a new user that will be stored in the firebase. 
Only authenticated users are able to see the content of the page.

If there for some reason is an issue with making a new user, you can use the one I already made: 
Email: hei@sveis.no
Password: heisveis

I am using and API from https://rawg.io/apidocs where I fetch data from different video games. 
The page automatically renders twenty games that you can sort by year of release, alphabetically or by rating score. You can also filter out video games based on genres and what platforms they are available on. I also implemented a search bare where you can search for the fetched games. 

On the bottom of the page there is a load more button that renders twenty more games.

I have set up a server so I was able to hide my API-key.
